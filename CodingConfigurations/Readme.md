In this fold you can create a beamforming and nullforming for Metasurface configuration. <br>

Before run the .m files, Please check the the following parameters:<br>
1.The number of unit-cells <br>
2.The beam directions (We advise you select the beam direction inside of the FoV limitations. ) <br>

The main function is Main_approachNullforming.m and when you finish the whole iterations, the Beamforming_Configuration.txt and Nullforming_Configuration.txt you can observed. <br> 

One of the result you can find in the Result.pdf. <br>

Due to time urgency, the current version of the code still has some minor issues. We will continue to follow up and modify it. Please look forward to the new version~
