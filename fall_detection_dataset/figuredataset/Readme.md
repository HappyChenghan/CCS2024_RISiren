# RFSiren: the dataset.zip is adapt for using the spectrogram images of CSI data to detect falling. 

Each sub-folder contain a kind of activity. 

If you want to use the dataset, you can use the datasetProcess.ipynb to quickly load and divide the dataset into train and test data.

The requirement of environment is as follows:

numpy 1.23.5

tensorflow 2.5.0

mkl-random 1.2.2
 
The CNN network sturacture can be observed in 《Wi-Fi-Based Fall Detection Using Spectrogram Image of Channel State Information》
